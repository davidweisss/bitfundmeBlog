Every crowdfunding campaign in BitFundMe is identified by a unique Bitcoin address.

A single Bitcoin wallet can generate as many addresses as needed.

The message signing capability is currently available only for one type of address: P2PKH. These addresses are easily recognizabe, starting with the digit '1'. (In the future, all addresses will be able to sign messages.)
