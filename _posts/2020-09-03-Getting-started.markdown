[BitFundMe][BitFundMe] is an entirely new type of app where you can remain anonymous while remaining in control of your information and also manage funds in Bitcoin.

Therefore, you will need a bitcoin wallet instead of a username and password to manage your stuff.

Think of the bitcoin wallet as using a bank fob you would use to sign your bank stuff, but without intrusion or friction.

BitFundMe uses a novel authentication method that uses digital signatures. To use this you will need a bitcoin wallet that can sign messages. If
you don't have one, check out the [Samourai Wallet][SamouraiWallet].

You don't need to know the details to get started, but if you're curious, there is a [tutorial dedicated to signing][signingTutorial].

# 1. Start and enter one of your bitcoin addresses
