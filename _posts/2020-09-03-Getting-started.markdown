[BitFundMe][BitFundMe]  is unlike every other app you may have used 
because you will need a bitcoin wallet instead of a username
and password to manage your stuff.

This is great because you can remain anonymous and also remain
in control of your funds.

Think of the bitcoin wallet as using a bank fob to sign
your bank stuff.

You will need a bitcoin wallet that can sign messages. If
you don't have one, check out the [Samourai Wallet][SamouraiWallet].

There is a full [tutorial dedicated to signing][signingTutorial].



# 1. Start and enter one of your bitcoin addresses
