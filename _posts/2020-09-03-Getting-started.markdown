[BitFundMe][BitFundMe] lets you create Bitcoin crowdfunding campaigns. It's an entirely new type of app where you can remain anonymous AND in control of your information and funds.

It works by using a bitcoin wallet instead of a username and password to manage your stuff. BitFundMe uses a novel authentication method based on digitally-signed messages. To use it you will need a bitcoin wallet that can sign messages. If you don't have one, check out the [Samourai Wallet][SamouraiWallet].

Think of the bitcoin wallet as a bank fob you would use to sign in your bank app -- but without intrusion and with less friction.

You don't need to know the details to get started, but if you're curious, there is a [tutorial dedicated to signing][signingTutorial].

Let's get started! 

Navigate to [https://BitFundMe.rocks][BitFundMeURL] and click 'Create'

## 1. Enter the bitcoin address where you wish to receive campaign funding

You will need a valid Bitcoin address. Check [this tutorial][Generate] about how to generate one.

## 3. Receive donations and promote your campaign on social media
There are two main actions on the campaign page: "Donate" to receive donations from Bitcoin wallets, and "Share", to spread the word on social media.
### Receive donations
<div style="text-align: center">
   <img alt="qr code" src="/assets/qr.svg" />
</div> 
<p align='center'> <i>Funds can be sent to your campaign simply by scanning the QR code displayed after clicking "Donate" on the campaign page.</i></p>
### Share campaign
<div style="text-align: center">
   <img alt="Share" src="/assets/share.svg" />
</div> 
<p align='center'> <i>Afer clicking the "Share" button on the campaign page, you can choose the social network where you wish to share your campaign.</i></p>
<br/>

## 4. Post campaign updates 
Posting campaign updates, like any modification after campaign creation, requires a digital signature proving that you own the campaign. Please see [this tutorial][signingTutorial] to complete this step.
